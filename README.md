# R-US_Gasoline_Pricise_Temporal_Data_Analysis
The work carried out in this paper aims to conduct a study on the trend of gasoline prices in the United States, using a historical series freely available online on the website of the EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration), in the "Petroleum & Other Liquids" section.

The data contained in the extracted dataset (a collection that starts from 1995 and arrives in 2021) are retail prices relating to different types and formulations of fuel.
